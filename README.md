# Ruby-Linters
This is a code linter like Rubocop that trawls through your code files and finds problems, such as methods with too many lines, code style violations, or common gotchas.

It also supports an --auto-correct option that can automatically correct certain issues. Itâ€™s pretty handy. ðŸ™‚
